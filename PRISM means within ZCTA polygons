## finding the average Tmax value within a ZCTA polygon

# importing a PRISM file as a raster
prism <- raster("file path to your stored .bil file")

# calculates the mean value for the prism raster within each ZCTA polygon
rast_mean <- extract(prism, zcta, fun = mean)
# this step takes a while to run for a single raster and would likely be very memory heavy if doing many days

# adds the calculated values to the ZCTA shapefile in the column tmax
# the rast_mean output is only the numbers. they are in the order of the ZCTAs listed within the shapefile so it is important not to reorder them before merging
zcta$tmax <- rast_mean[1:6502]

# comparing this output with the output of the centroids gives a correlation coefficient of 0.9996447
